# Car Price Prediction API

A FastAPI-based machine learning API that predicts used car prices based on input features such as year, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and owner count.

This project is containerized with Docker and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Features

-  Predicts car resale price using a trained Random Forest model
-  Built with FastAPI
-  Dockerized
-  Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces
-  Interactive Swagger docs for testing

## Model Input Format

```json
{
  "year": 2017,
  "mileage": 45000,
  "fuel_type": 0,
  "transmission": 1,
  "owner": 0
}
```

- `fuel_type`: 0 = Petrol, 1 = Diesel, 2 = CNG
- `transmission`: 0 = Manual, 1 = Automatic
- `owner`: 0 = First owner, 1 = Second owner, etc.
